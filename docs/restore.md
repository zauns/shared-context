# Restore Shared Context from a backup

Backups live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\shared-context\backups\` by default:

- `backups/db/shared-context-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.db` — consistent SQLite snapshots.
- `backups/attachments/<attachment-id>/` — mirrored attachment files.
- `backups/last-backup.json` — timestamp, size, attachment count, and success status.

The nightly scheduler and **Backup now** in Project settings use the same procedure. Never
copy a live `shared-context.db` with a file copy while the daemon is running; use a
snapshot.

## Before restoring

1. Stop the daemon: close its console, or run
   `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\uninstall-startup.ps1` if it was
   installed as a logon task. Stopping the task does not kill an already-running daemon;
   end the `node` process for this workspace if necessary.
2. Make a copy of the current `data/` directory aside, in case the restore is the wrong
   choice.
3. Pick the newest snapshot whose `last-backup.json` entry reports `"ok": true`, or an
   older snapshot if you need to go further back.

## Restore the database

1. Delete or rename the stale database and its WAL files:
   `data\shared-context.db`, `data\shared-context.db-wal`, `data\shared-context.db-shm`.
2. Copy the chosen snapshot to `data\shared-context.db`.
3. Do **not** copy the backup's `-wal` files; the snapshot is self-contained.

## Restore attachments

The attachment mirror is additive and keeps immutable files. Copy any missing directory
from `backups\attachments\` into `data\attachments\`:

```powershell
robocopy "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\shared-context\backups\attachments" `
         "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\shared-context\data\attachments" `
         /E /XC /XN /XO
```

`/E` copies subdirectories; the exclusion flags keep files that already exist. The app
tolerates extra files in the mirror; a database snapshot only references attachments that
existed before it.

## Start and verify

1. Start the daemon with `npm start`, or reinstall the logon task with
   `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-startup.ps1`.
2. Check `http://127.0.0.1:4319/healthz`; `ok` must be `true`, `db.journal_mode` should be
   `wal`, and `last_backup` should describe the snapshot you restored.
3. Open the board, spot-check a few Issues, open an attachment, and confirm Activity is
   present.
4. Run a fresh **Backup now** after verifying, so the next snapshot reflects the restored
   state.

## Restoring on another machine

- Install Node 24 and run `npm install` + `npm run build` in this repository.
- Copy the `shared-context.db` snapshot and the attachment mirror into the new machine's
  data directory.
- Run the daemon once so it creates `%APPDATA%\shared-context\config.json` with a new MCP
  token, then update MCP clients with that token from Global settings.
- Reinstall the logon task after confirming `/healthz`.

Secrets: the config file contains the MCP token. Do not commit it, include it in exports, or
share backups without considering that they may contain sensitive Issue and attachment
content. Backups are not encrypted by the app.
