# One local daemon owns the database and serves MCP, API, and UI

We use a single long-lived local process on `127.0.0.1` as the only writer to the SQLite database, exposing MCP over Streamable HTTP, a JSON API, and an SSE event stream for the kanban. A stdio MCP server spawned per agent session would put several processes on one database, lose the shared event bus, and make the live UI a polling afterthought. The trade-off is that the daemon must be running; it starts at logon and all agents connect to the same process.
