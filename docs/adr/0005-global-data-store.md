# One global data store, with Markdown export for portability

All Projects live in one SQLite database and one managed attachment directory under the user's local application data, rather than in per-repository `.shared-context` folders. A single store makes cross-project queries, one backup, and one daemon straightforward; per-repository databases would multiply connections and invite live database files into git or file-sync tools, which corrupt them. Portability is handled by an explicit Markdown and JSON export instead of by syncing the live store.
